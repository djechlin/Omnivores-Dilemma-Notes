* Thesis of the chapter: "And yield, measured in bushels per acre, is the measure of all things here in corn country." [which creates monotony.]

* Short natural history lesson on Iowa corn, presumably to show how much we wrecked it.

* Farmers are broke too. Crops are inedible. Biodiversity is gone. Iowe imports 80% of its food: shocking. "This Iowa cornfield (and all the others just like it) is the place most of our food comes from" - invokes chapter 1.

* Introduce soybeans, found in 2/3 of all processed foods by some study. Note how unrigorous this is: define processed? how measured? etc.

* Metaphor between monotony of corn, monoculture that depletes life, lack of diversity in life, simpleton-ness of farmers is woven thick. Surreptitious argument for thesis of book.

* Another case of nonscientific-ness: "The only other domesticated species ever to have multiplied its productivity by such a factor is the Holstein cow." This is historiographically nontrivial.

* Monotonous landscape of Greene country. Monotony is huge theme of chapter (and book).

* Government introduced as enemy. "The economics and psychology of agriculture are such that exactly the opposite happen." Economics is also the enemy.

* Corn pushes out people. This place called Churdan a ghost time.

* Corn is "welfare queen." Begins in 1947 when munitions plant produces fertilizer. Ammonium nitrate was used in explosives, now fertilizer. Corn consumes more fertilizer (per what?) than any other crop. Malthusian landscape pre-fertilizer. THEN WHY ARE YOU SO ANTI-FERTILIZER. "Fixing nitrogen is the most important invention of the twentieth century."

* Awkward tangent on how the scientist who invented this helped the Nazis. *Very* gratuitously points out that good and evil come from the same scientific knowledge.

* "Synthetic fertilizer opens the way to monoculture" because biological constraints on nitrogen rotation removed. Also switched our calories to petro.

* Dysfunctional corn economy: economics of small business different than corporation. When corn prices fall, must produce more of it to make ends meet because no choice! Now for some history.

* New Deal program: farmer can take loan and use crop as collateral and pay back when grain prices recover by selling corn. Began dismantling in the 50s, "plague of cheap corn", Butz, grain sell to Russia, corn prices skyrocket, grocery inflation all-time high by 73, farmers encouraged (how?) to "get big or get out", Ever-Normal granary abolished, price floor removed, now farmers just paid to make corn a fixed amount so they grow as much as possible, $5b subsidies now.

I still don't know how much meat would cost without corn subsidies.
