* "A naturalist in the supermarket." Immediately implicits claim that supermarkets are part of nature. Portrays them as very diverse and bountiful. Getting at this funny juxtaposition of artificially natural. Produce -> meat -> processed foods seems to be the order.

* Asks the question: "What _am_ I eating?" By now reader should be convinced this is nontrivial. That was the point of reminding reader supermarket is full of stuff from nature: sure as heck doesn't look like it, wait a minute, what is it? Author then claims it all goes back to corn. (This bothers me a little. Meat does. Veggies don't as much.)

* Hat-trick: two pages ago supermarkets were diversely full of fruits and vegetables and meats and processed foods. Now the diversity is a bunch of processed versions of corn: HFCS, any sort of sugar, it's used in cardboard. Now back down to > 1/4 of the 45,000 foodstuffs in supermarkets contain corn. **Pollan is inconsistent in how much he claims we are corn people.** Sometimes all we eat is corn (pilgrims), sometimes it's merely in everything, sometimes it's the entire industrial food chain. In summary (exaggerating with "all" but these are the buckets):
    * corn is all settlers and early European Americans ate
    * all meat is corn
    * corn is in every processed food
    * corn is used in non-food steps for produce, like fertilizer and packaging

* Biology now. C-4 trick: corn captures more carbon. This lets us tell how much corn we are, since it grabs more C-13 isotopes since it can'tafford to care. Annoyed he skips out on an actual percentage corn carbon we are.

* Introducing biology logic: corn is a success. Corn arguably conquered us. Follows the narrative of putting people back in the plant world, but I believe is philosophically and biologically well-founded. "Corn domesticated us."

Review question:  Why did corn dominate America?

* captures more carbon
* "prodigious genetic variability" lets it adapt to all climates
* ready to eat
* or can store grain
* source of fiber
* can feed animals
* heating fuel
* intoxicant (?)
* make whiskey
* has the economic properties of money (store of value)
* can produce uniform generations, hence mechanizable, scalable, monoculture
* strange sex life means requires human intervention to breed, ergo artificial selection is necessary
* hybrids create intellectual property, insanely unusual and important

Pollan goes into the biology in some detail, I think to show how distinct corn is and how it "conquered" us. This is important because this entire chapter of the book is an argument against monoculture, and corn's biological properties are necessary for that.

By the way, insanely nontrivial to do this historical analysis on corn as currency. Glib and suspect analysis.
